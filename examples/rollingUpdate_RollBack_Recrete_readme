1. **Deploy an application:** Deploy a simple application to Kubernetes, such as the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: nginx:latest
```

2. **Verify the deployment:** Use the `kubectl get deployment` command to verify that the deployment is running and that all of the pods are ready:

```
kubectl get deployment my-app
```

3. **Perform a rolling update:** Update the deployment spec to use a new image, such as the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: nginx:latest-alpine
```

Then, apply the updated deployment spec to the Kubernetes cluster:

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

4. **Verify the rolling update:** Use the `kubectl rollout status deployment my-app` command to monitor the rolling update process. Once the update is complete, all of the pods will be running the new image.

5. **Rollback the update:** If you are not satisfied with the new version of the application, you can roll back to the previous version using the following command:

```
$ kubectl rollout undo deployment my-app
```

This will recreate the deployment using the previous revision.

6. **Verify the rollback:** Use the `kubectl get deployment my-app` command to verify that the deployment has rolled back to the previous version.

7. **Recreate the deployment:** If you need to recreate the deployment from scratch, you can use the following command:

```
$ kubectl delete deployment my-app
```

This will delete the deployment.

Then, you can create the deployment again using the same deployment spec:

```
$ kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
```

8. **Verify the recreation:** Use the `kubectl get deployment my-app` command to verify that the deployment has been recreated.

By following these steps, you can verify the rolling updates, rollback, and recreate concepts in Kubernetes.
